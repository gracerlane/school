// Purpose: The purpose of this program is to play a game of chutes and ladders
//  with one other opponent. Each player will take turns going back and forth.
//  They will spin a number between RANGE_MIN and RANGE_MAX. Depending on the
//  number they spin, some action will be taken. This will repeat until one 
//  player reaches exactly GOAL. If they go over, their spin will not count.

int spin();
// returns a valid spin value from RANGE_MIN to RANGE_MAX

int checkLocation(int location);
// returns value of chute or ladder at current location
// returns 0 if none

int takeTurn(int position, string name);
// takes turn for name
// returns position
