// Purpose: This program will open a menu to allow the user to play the game,
//  see the top three scores, or quit. If the user chooses to play, the program
//  will choose a random number between a range of numbers. Then, the user will
//  input a guess until they get the correct number. They can play the game as
//  many times as they would like.
